### Summary
Read [this italian document](https://goo.gl/ANQWbo) to know more about myLuisella project.

TL;DR myLuisella is a restaurant handler app. It is composed of 3 main parts: kitchen app, waiter app and server one. They are written in HTML5, CSS and JS to be installable on Firefox OS devices or executable via web browser.

The following paragraph describes how to setup the entire environment.

### Installation and usage
Download the latest release version and not the master branch to be sure to download software tested by the developer.

For best performance it is recommended to have a single device to be used as a server.

On the server, clone myLuisella-server repository and follow that README.md to configure the server:

      git clone https://www.github.com/themetrio/myLuisella-server.git

Now you can start ```waiter/index.html``` and ```kitchen/index.html``` on your client devices to substitute your server ip setting with your own server ip.

Log in and you're done!
